    "# Calculate percent increase or decrease in stock price for Netflix.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Identify a viable percent increase/decrease that will indicate buy or sell action. Assume a 20% increase or decrease in stock price should warrant buy or sell action.\n",

    "# Use conditional statements to determine whether or not a stock should be purchased or sold:\n",

    "#  Increase = Current Price - Original Price\n",

    "1. Initialize \"current_price\" and \"original_price\" to float\n",
    "2. Calcualate \"increase\" which is \"current_price\" minus \"original_price\" \n",
    "3. Calculate \"percent_increase\" which is \"increase\" divided by \"original_price\" multiplied by 100%\n",

    "4. If \"percent_increase\" is more than 20% then buy the stock\n",

    "Using the [starter file](Unsolved/conditionally_yours_part_1.py), complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pseudocode variable declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pseudocode `percent_increase` calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pseudocode `if-else` logic to determine the buy or sell recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by writing the logic out in plain language. Then, refine it into pseudocode.\n",
